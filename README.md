This repo contains files for the following features:
- A mini-framework for performing GPU tasks
- Efficient, extensible, and customizable GPU-based procedural level generation
- Terrain Biome categorization and object spawning on a per-biome basis
- A custom tilemap shader for rendering of the generated level efficiently
- 8-directional 2D character movement
